## Joystick emulation for use in simulators.

Needs vJoy installed.

Tested with an Iflight Commando 8 TX radio and a HappyModel 900mhz RX hooked up to an FTDI USB Serial reading cable.

Mapped channels => joystick movements work out of the box. Aux buttons are mapped to windows buttons 1,2,3,4.

Build from root dir:

```
.\examples\joystick\build-exe.bat
```
